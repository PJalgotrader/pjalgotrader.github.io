# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript academic portfolio website for Pedram Jahangiry, Professional Practice Associate Professor at Utah State University. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and showcases research, teaching, interactive tools, and professional background.

## Development Commands

### Local Development Server
Since this is a static site, serve it locally using one of these methods:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if available)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### No Build Process

### Standalone HTML Approach
**Design Philosophy**: All interactive tools are implemented as standalone HTML files to:
- Maintain static site architecture (no build process required)
- Ensure long-term reliability and independence from external services
- Provide professional presentation integrated with the academic portfolio
- Enable full customization and branding consistency

### Visualization Features
Each standalone visualization includes:
- **D3.js integration** for interactive charts with hover tooltips
- **Professional styling** matching the main site design
- **Responsive design** for all device types
- **Educational controls** for parameter adjustment
- **Academic branding** with author attribution and site links
- **Independent tooltip systems** for multi-chart interfaces

### Converting Claude Artifacts to Standalone HTML
When migrating visualizations from Claude artifacts:

1. **Extract core functionality** from TSX/React components
2. **Convert to vanilla JavaScript** using D3.js for charts
3. **Implement standalone styling** using CSS (avoid framework dependencies)
4. **Add interactive tooltips** with chart-specific positioning
5. **Integrate branding** (header links, attribution, styling consistency)
6. **Test responsiveness** across devices and screen sizes
7. **Update visualizations.html** links to point to local files

### Tooltip Implementation Details
Interactive charts use D3.js with:
- **Chart-specific tooltips** (`#tooltip-{chartType}`) to avoid cross-chart interference
- **Hover lines and circles** for precise data point identification
- **Real-time positioning** calculated relative to each chart container
- **Multi-series support** showing all series values at the current time point
- **Smooth show/hide animations** for professional user experience

1. **AR(1) & MA(1) Models** - Building blocks of ARIMA
2. **SARIMA Model** - Seasonal ARIMA with airline passenger data

  - **p**: AR(1) short-term autocorrelation
  - **P, Q**: Seasonal AR/MA effects
- Forecast horizon adjustable from 12-60 months
- Real-time model notation display

#### Educational Parameter Effects
The SARIMA visualization demonstrates:
- **d=0**: Flat forecast (no trend projection)
- **d=1**: Linear trend continuation (optimal)
- **d=2**: Smoother trend
- **D=0**: Seasonal pattern decays over time
- **D=1**: Seasonal growth continues (optimal)
- **P>0**: Amplifies seasonal peaks/troughs
- **Q>0**: Smooths seasonal fluctuations
- **p>0**: Adds short-term AR "momentum"
- **q>0**: Overall forecast smoothing

#### Optimal Model Explanation
**SARIMA(1,1,0)(0,1,0)₁₂** is optimal for airline data because:
- **Parsimonious**: Uses minimal parameters (principle of parsimony)
- **d=1**: First differencing removes upward trend
- **D=1**: Seasonal differencing removes 12-month cycles
- **p=1**: Captures short-term autocorrelation
- **P=0, Q=0**: Seasonal differencing alone handles seasonality efficiently
